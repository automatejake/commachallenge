# Comma.ai Programming Challenge
Mapping one thousand trips for a comma.ai project using MongoDB, Express, Node.JS, and PUG templating.

I had 1000 .json trips in a zip file that I put on my server and imported into MongoDb with a shell script.  The first point of each trip was mapped using leaflet on top of Open Street Maps tiling system.  When a user drags the cursor over (or presses on a mobile device), a trip is rendered along with statistics describing that trip. 

I had to remove this from my server at https://comma.automatejake.com because it was one of many projects eating resources.

Download this repo, looks like node modules are included, I forget which port it will run on.
